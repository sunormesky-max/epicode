## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.1] - 2026-06-21

### Fixed

- Fixed admin authentication bypass in `cloud.rs` by rejecting empty `admin_key` and missing/empty `X-Admin-Key` header.
- Converted `blocking()` wrapper to return `Result<T, String>` instead of panicking when a `spawn_blocking` task fails.
- Added `SecurityConfig::try_from_env()` to avoid startup panic; cloud mode now exits gracefully on missing `TETRAMEM_API_KEY`.

### Security

- Replaced `ureq` with `attohttpc` in cognitive, embedding, and classifier modules.
- Limited Cloud TCP server concurrency with a `tokio::sync::Semaphore` to prevent unbounded OS thread creation.

### Changed

- Upgraded `ort` from `2.0.0-rc.9` to `2.0.0-rc.12`.
